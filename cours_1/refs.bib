  abstract = {Marketing scholars increasingly use web scraping and application programming interfaces (APIs) to collect data from the internet. Yet, despite the widespread use of such web data, the idiosyncratic and sometimes insidious challenges in its collection have received limited attention. How can researchers ensure that the data sets generated via web scraping and APIs are valid? While existing resources emphasize technical details of extracting web data, the authors propose a novel methodological framework focused on enhancing its validity. In particular, the framework highlights how addressing validity concerns requires the joint consideration of idiosyncratic technical and legal/ethical questions along the three stages of collecting web data: selecting data sources, designing the data collection, and extracting the data. The authors further review more than 300 articles using web data published in the top five marketing journals and offer a typology of how web data have advanced marketing thought. The article concludes with directions for future research to identify promising web data sources and embrace novel approaches for using web data to capture and describe evolving marketplace realities.},

  abstract = {The data mining (DM) is the computational process that consists of searching, extracting, and analyzing patterns in large data sets, including methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database schemes. Specifically, its primary goal is to extract information from a raw data set and transform it into an expected structure for further use. Moreover, an evolving perspective of DM is web mining (WM), which refers to the whole of DM and related routines. It is used to discover and extract information from web records and services automatically, that is, WM's purpose is to obtain valuable data from the World Wide Web. Due to its importance, a survey about DM techniques in WM is necessary, as performed in this paper. ~ Received: 30 June 2022 \textbar{} Revised: 30 September 2022 \textbar{} Accepted: 25 October 2022 ~ Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.},

  abstract = {Web scraping or web crawling refers to the procedure of automatic extraction of data from websites using software. It is a process that is particularly important in fields such as Business Intelligence in the modern age. Web scrapping is a technology that allow us to extract structured data from text such as HTML. Web scrapping is extremely useful in situations where data isn't provided in machine readable format such as JSON or XML. The use of web scrapping to gather data allows us to gather prices in near real time from retail store sites and provide further details, web scrapping can also be used to gather intelligence of illicit businesses such as drug marketplaces in the darknet to provide law enforcement and researchers valuable data such as drug prices and varieties that would be unavailable with conventional methods. It has been found that using a web scraping program would yield data that is far more thorough, accurate, and consistent than manual entry. Based on the result it has been concluded that Web scraping is a highly useful tool in the information age, and an essential one in the modern fields. Multiple technologies are required to implement web scrapping properly such as spidering and pattern matching which are discussed. This paper is looking into what web scraping is, how it works, web scraping stages, technologies, how it relates to Business Intelligence, artificial intelligence, data science, big data, cyber securityو how it can be done with the Python language, some of the main benefits of web scraping, and what the future of web scraping may look like, and a special degree of emphasis is placed on highlighting the ethical and legal issues.},

However, it remains unclear how the APIs of leading social media relate to platform governance and how this relationship evolved. This article traces the evolution of Facebook's APIs, which evolved from a relatively simple programming interface for data access into a complex layered and interconnected governance arrangement. The study draws on a large corpus of (archived) developer pages and API reference documentation to examine the history of Facebook's API governance; that is, the governance of and by Facebook through its APIs. This historical analysis emphasizes the technical dimensions and dynamics of what, how, and whom powerful platforms seek to govern, thus highlighting the technicity of platform governance and how it evolved. Because APIs facilitate and govern the material conditions of app development and the social and economic processes they sustain, powerful platforms influence the evolution of their larger ecosystems. As such, the technicity of Facebook's API governance represents a major source of the platform's ``infrastructural power.''},

  abstract = {As brands' use of social media to connect with customers becomes increasingly important, there is a need to continually monitor social network activities. Although numerous studies have examined consumer behaviors on social media, only a handful of studies have adopted a social network analysis approach. Considering this gap, the current study analyzed Twitter networks of two multi-brand retailers to investigate network activities. The findings from analyzing network patterns reveal that while brands are able to deliver messages through digital platforms, they may only have limited control over the communications within networks, and thus cannot govern the spread of information.},

  abstract = {Predicting unmeasurable wealth                            In developing countries, collecting data on basic economic quantities, such as wealth and income, is costly, time-consuming, and unreliable. Taking advantage of the ubiquity of mobile phones in Rwanda, Blumenstock               et al.               mapped mobile phone metadata inputs to individual phone subscriber wealth. They applied the model to predict wealth throughout Rwanda and show that the predictions matched well with those from detailed boots-on-the-ground surveys of the population.                                         Science               , this issue p.               1073                        ,              Metadata from individuals’ phones can be used to predict aggregate-level characteristics such as access to electricity.           ,              Accurate and timely estimates of population characteristics are a critical input to social and economic research and policy. In industrialized economies, novel sources of data are enabling new approaches to demographic profiling, but in developing countries, fewer sources of big data exist. We show that an individual’s past history of mobile phone use can be used to infer his or her socioeconomic status. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the predicted attributes of millions of individuals can, in turn, accurately reconstruct the distribution of wealth of an entire nation or to infer the asset distribution of microregions composed of just a few households. In resource-constrained environments where censuses and household surveys are rare, this approach creates an option for gathering localized and timely information at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.},

  abstract = {In practice marketing can and should play an important role in mobile applications when formulating marketing strategies. The aim of this article is to identify the main KPIs to measure the effect of marketing strategies in mobile applications. To achieve this goal, we carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) on the topic of mobile applications and marketing strategies. The search terms consulted in the databases were KPIs, marketing and mobile applications obtaining a total of n = 1,088 studies. The databases consulted to extract data where Scopus, PubMed, PsyINFO, ScienceDirect and Web of Science. The results obtained in this research were the identification, development and analysis of the main quantitative and qualitative KPIs to measure the effect of marketing strategies in mobile applications. Furthermore, we name the main scientific journals developing further studies on this subject, as well as on the most relevant topics within the industry. The results of the research can be used to enhance mobile APP marketing strategy analysis and thus, enhance their development, both in the scientific and the professional sectors.},
